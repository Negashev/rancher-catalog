# NATS

Open Source. Simple. Secure. Scalable.
NATS is now a hosted CNCF Project

### Info:

NATS Server is a simple, high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation member project. Members of the Synadia team created the NATS Server (written in Go), NATS Streaming, and clients written in Python, Ruby, Node.js, Elixir, Java, NGINX, C, and C#. The community has contributed a growing list of libraries, including Arduino, Rust, Lua, PHP, Perl, and more.

Companies like Ericsson, HTC, Siemens, VMware, Pivotal, GE and Baidu rely on the NATS enterprise messaging system for its highly performant and resilient capabilities.
